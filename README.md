## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cycling Route Simulator

### Project Overview

A web application that enables cyclists to draw routes on an interactive map and simulate a cycling journey along those routes with smooth animation.

---

### Features

#### 1. Map Interface

* Interactive map view powered by **Leaflet**
* Drawing tool to plot routes using **LineString** geometry
* Basic map controls: zoom, pan, etc.
* Clear visual feedback during route drawing

#### 2. Route Management

* Routes stored in **GeoJSON** format
* Calculates and displays key statistics: distance, estimated time
* Save and load routes functionality
* Basic validation to ensure route correctness

#### 3. Route Simulation

* Animated marker that moves along the drawn route
* Play, pause, and reset controls for the simulation
* Adjustable speed control
* Real-time display of current position metrics

### Technical Specifications

#### Frontend

* React with TypeScript
* Leaflet for mapping
* RxJS for managing simulation events
* Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI components
* Redux for state management

#### Backend

* Node.js with Express.js
* Prisma ORM
* PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for spatial data
* RESTful API design
* WebSocket support for real-time updates
